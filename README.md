## Overview of CoE Acquisitions

At the Centers of Excellence (CoE), we emphasize user-centric approaches in the technical solutions we help agencies implement. In order to do the same for our acquisitions, we have posted the templates we use to build out our procurement packages to this repository.

Considering the "user" of a procurement package is a Government procurement professional *as well as* the contractors that submit responses and are issued awards based on them, we want feedback from everyone. To serve that mission, we are using [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/rGnHk5qFQGnf7UYe8) to represent an "indefinite Request for Information", asking anyone who is interested to help us improve our documentation and the associated processes.

## Current CoE templates

Please remember these are only templates we use to build out Phase II procurements and there is no acquisition associated with these documents. Thanks!
